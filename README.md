#DSA laboratory works 

This repository contains code files (in C) for laboratory works, that were completed during university Data Structures and Algorithms course

##A small description for the files, their content, and the topics of LW

2. dsa_lab_2.c - LW №2: Implementation of one-sided linked-list ADT and member functions
3. dsa_lab_3.c - LW №3: Implementation of queue ADT and member functions
4. dsa_lab_4.c - LW №4: Implementation of Binary Search Tree and some of the member functions
5. dsa_lab_5.c - LW №5: Implementation of Shunting Yard algorithm
6. dsa_lab_6.c - LW №6: Implementation of Heap Sort algorithm
